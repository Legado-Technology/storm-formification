3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you are satisified the it will not adversely affect existing implementations, if a release will introduce breaking changes then these should be documented

## Release Process

In order to complete a release you will need to create a new release within the github interface, adding appropriate release notes and a tagged version that increments the build based on:

Tags should be named: <MAJOR>.<MINOR.<PATCH> and tags should exclude trailing 0 version numbers: i.e. `0.2`, but `0.2.0`

- non-breaking change or bugfix (increment patch version)
- introduction of new functionality or feature (increment minor version)
- introduction of a breaking change (increment major version)

Once a github release is created an Azure DevOps build will need to be manually triggered, specifying the tag as a build branch, for example: `refs/tags/0.2.1`
